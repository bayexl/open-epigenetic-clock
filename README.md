Open Epigenetic Clock: Robust Biological Age Estimation 🧬A production-ready machine learning framework for estimating biological age from DNA methylation data. Features a validated "Lite" panel of 20 biomarkers optimized for low-cost screening.📌 Project OverviewEpigenetic clocks (e.g., Horvath, Hannum) are the gold standard for quantifying biological aging. However, most existing models rely on high-dimensional genomic arrays (Illumina 450k/EPIC), which are cost-prohibitive (~$300+/sample) for widespread population screening.This project implements a reproducible, open-source pipeline to:Train a robust age estimator using Elastic Net Regression on public methylation data ($n=656$).Validate the model on an independent external cohort ($n=689$) to ensure generalizability.Engineer a commercially viable "Lite" panel of just 20 genes that retains ~85% of the accuracy at ~10% of the sequencing cost.📊 Key Performance MetricsThe model was trained on the Hannum cohort (GSE40279) and blindly validated on the Liu cohort (GSE42861).Model VersionFeature CountMAE (Validation)Correlation (R)Est.

Involved in fatty acid elongation; a standard forensic age marker.FHL2 (cg22454769): Associated with cardiovascular aging and transcriptional regulation.KLF14 (cg14361627): Linked to metabolic traits and Type 2 diabetes risk.ITGA2B (cg08097417): Integrin alpha-IIb, associated with platelet function and immune aging.🛠️ Methodology & Tech StackThe pipeline utilizes a high-performance machine learning approach suitable for high-dimensional genomic data ($p >> n$):Language: Python 3.10+Libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, numpy, seabornAlgorithm: Elastic Net Regression (L1/L2 regularization) with Cross-Validation.Optimization: Pareto frontier analysis to determine the minimal viable feature set.Pipeline ArchitectureIngestion: Automated fetching of raw beta-values from NCBI GEO.Preprocessing: Sex-chromosome filtering, missing value imputation, and probe alignment.Feature Selection: Univariate pre-filtering ($f$-regression) to reduce dimensionality.Training: Elastic Net optimization ($\alpha$ and $l1\_ratio$ tuning).Productization: Recalibration of a linear model on the top 20 features for the "Lite" panel.🚀 Installation & UsageTo replicate this analysis or use the clock on your own data:1.
